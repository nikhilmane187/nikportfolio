<h1 align="center">Babel Loader</h1>

This package allows transpiling JavaScript files using [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) and [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

**Note**: Issues with the output should be reported on the Babel [Issues](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues) tracker.

<h2 align="center">Install</h2>

> webpack 4.x | babel-loader 8.x | babel 7.x

```bash
npm install -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env webpack
```

> webpack 4.x | babel-loader 7.x | babel 6.x

```bash
npm install -D babel-loader@7 babel-core babel-preset-env webpack
```

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

webpack documentation: [Loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/)

Within your webpack configuration object, you'll need to add the babel-loader to the list of modules, like so:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.m?js$/,
      exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
      use: {
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        options: {
          presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Options

See the `babel` [options](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options).

You can pass options to the loader by using the [`options`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rule-options-rule-query) property:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.m?js$/,
      exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
      use: {
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        options: {
          presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
          plugins: [require('@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread')]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This loader also supports the following loader-specific option:

* `cacheDirectory`: Default `false`. When set, the given directory will be used to cache the results of the loader. Future webpack builds will attempt to read from the cache to avoid needing to run the potentially expensive Babel recompilation process on each run. If the value is blank (`loader: 'babel-loader?cacheDirectory'`) or `true` (`loader: 'babel-loader?cacheDirectory=true'`), the loader will use the default cache directory in `node_modules/.cache/babel-loader` or fallback to the default OS temporary file directory if no `node_modules` folder could be found in any root directory.

* `cacheIdentifier`: Default is a string composed by the `babel-core`'s version, the `babel-loader`'s version, the contents of `.babelrc` file if it exists, and the value of the environment variable `BABEL_ENV` with a fallback to the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. This can be set to a custom value to force cache busting if the identifier changes.

* `cacheCompression`: Default `true`. When set, each Babel transform output will be compressed with Gzip. If you want to opt-out of cache compression, set it to `false` -- your project may benefit from this if it transpiles thousands of files.

* `customize`: Default `null`. The path of a module that exports a `custom` callback [like the one that you'd pass to `.custom()`](#customized-loader). Since you already have to make a new file to use this, it is recommended that you instead use `.custom` to create a wrapper loader. Only use this is you _must_ continue using `babel-loader` directly, but still want to customize.

**Note**: The `sourceMap` option is ignored. Instead, source maps are automatically enabled when webpack is configured to use them (via the [`devtool`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/#devtool) config option).

## Troubleshooting

### babel-loader is slow!

Make sure you are transforming as few files as possible. Because you are probably matching `/\.m?js$/`, you might be transforming the `node_modules` folder or other unwanted source.

To exclude `node_modules`, see the `exclude` option in the `loaders` config as documented above.

You can also speed up babel-loader by as much as 2x by using the `cacheDirectory` option. This will cache transformations to the filesystem.

### Babel is injecting helpers into each file and bloating my code!

Babel uses very small helpers for common functions such as `_extend`. By default, this will be added to every file that requires it.

You can instead require the Babel runtime as a separate module to avoid the duplication.

The following configuration disables automatic per-file runtime injection in Babel, requiring `babel-plugin-transform-runtime` instead and making all helper references use it.

See the [docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-runtime/) for more information.

**NOTE**: You must run `npm install -D @babel/plugin-transform-runtime` to include this in your project and `babel-runtime` itself as a dependency with `npm install @babel/runtime`.

```javascript
rules: [
  // the 'transform-runtime' plugin tells Babel to
  // require the runtime instead of inlining it.
  {
    test: /\.m?js$/,
    exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
    use: {
      loader: 'babel-loader',
      options: {
        presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
        plugins: ['@babel/plugin-transform-runtime']
      }
    }
  }
]
```

#### **NOTE**: transform-runtime & custom polyfills (e.g. Promise library)
