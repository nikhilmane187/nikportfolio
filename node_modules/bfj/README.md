## Why would I want those?

If you need
to parse huge JSON strings
or stringify huge JavaScript data sets,
it monopolises the event loop
and can lead to out-of-memory exceptions.
BFJ implements asynchronous functions
and uses pre-allocated fixed-length arrays
to try and alleviate those issues.

## Is it fast?

No.

BFJ yields frequently
to avoid monopolising the event loop,
interrupting its own execution
to let other event handlers run.
The frequency of those yields
can be controlled with the [`yieldRate` option](#what-options-can-i-specify),
but fundamentally it is not designed for speed.

Furthermore,
when serialising data to a stream,
BFJ uses a fixed-length buffer
to avoid exhausting available memory.
Whenever that buffer is full,
serialisation is paused
until the receiving stream processes some more data,
regardless of the value of `yieldRate`.
You can control the size of the buffer
using the [`bufferLength` option](#options-for-serialisation-functions)
but really,
if you need quick results,
BFJ is not for you.

## What functions does it implement?

Nine functions
are exported.

Five are
concerned with
parsing, or
turning JSON strings
into JavaScript data:

* [`read`](#how-do-i-read-a-json-file)
  asynchronously parses
  a JSON file from disk.

* [`parse` and `unpipe`](#how-do-i-parse-a-stream-of-json)
  are for asynchronously parsing
  streams of JSON.

* [`match`](#how-do-i-selectively-parse-individual-items-from-a-json-stream)
  selectively parses individual items
  from a JSON stream.

* [`walk`](#bfjwalk-stream-options)
  asynchronously walks
  a stream,
  emitting events
  as it encounters
  JSON tokens.
  Analagous to a
  [SAX parser][sax].

The other four functions
handle the reverse transformations,
serialising
JavaScript data
to JSON:

* [`write`](#how-do-i-write-a-json-file)
  asynchronously serialises data
  to a JSON file on disk.

* [`streamify`](#how-do-i-create-a-stream-of-json)
  asynchronously serialises data
  to a stream of JSON.

* [`stringify`](#how-do-i-create-a-json-string)
  asynchronously serialises data
  to a JSON string.

* [`eventify`](#bfjeventify-data-options)
  asynchronously traverses
  a data structure
  depth-first,
  emitting events
  as it encounters items.
  By default
  it coerces
  promises, buffers and iterables
  to JSON-friendly values.

## How do I install it?

If you're using npm:

```
npm i bfj --save
```

Or if you just want
the git repo:

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:philbooth/bfj.git
```

## How do I read a JSON file?

```js
const bfj = require('bfj');

bfj.read(path, options)
  .then(data => {
    // :)
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // :(
  });
```

`read` returns a [bluebird promise][promise] and
asynchronously parses
a JSON file
from disk.

It takes two arguments;
the path to the JSON file
and an [options](#options-for-parsing-functions) object.

If there are
no syntax errors,
the returned promise is resolved
with the parsed data.
If syntax errors occur,
the promise is rejected
with the first error.

## How do I parse a stream of JSON?

```js
const bfj = require('bfj');

// By passing a readable stream to bfj.parse():
bfj.parse(fs.createReadStream(path), options)
  .then(data => {
    // :)
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // :(
  });

// ...or by passing the result from bfj.unpipe() to stream.pipe():
request({ url }).pipe(bfj.unpipe((error, data) => {
  if (error) {
    // :(
  } else {
    // :)
  }
}))
```

* `parse` returns a [bluebird promise][promise]
  and asynchronously parses
  a stream of JSON data.

  It takes two arguments;
  a [readable stream][readable]
  from which
  the JSON
  will be parsed
  and an [options](#options-for-parsing-functions) object.

  If there are
  no syntax errors,
  the returned promise is resolved
  with the parsed data.
  If syntax errors occur,
  the promise is rejected
  with the first error.

* `unpipe` returns a [writable stream][writable]
  that can be passed to [`stream.pipe`][pipe],
  then parses JSON data
  read from the stream.

  It takes two arguments;
  a callback function
  that will be called
  after parsing is complete
  and an [options](#options-for-parsing-functions) object.

  If there are no errors,
  the callback is invoked
  with the result as the second argument.
  If errors occur,
  the first error is passed
  the callback
  as the first argument.

## How do I selectively parse individual items from a JSON stream?

```js
const bfj = require('bfj');

// Call match with your stream and a selector predicate/regex/string
const dataStream = bfj.match(jsonStream, selector, options);

// Get data out of the returned stream with event handlers
dataStream.on('data', item => { /* ... */ });
dataStream.on('end', () => { /* ... */);
dataStream.on('error', () => { /* ... */);
dataStream.on('dataError', () => { /* ... */);

// ...or you can pipe it to another stream
dataStream.pipe(someOtherStream);
```

`match` returns a readable, object-mode stream
and asynchronously parses individual matching items
from an input JSON stream.

It takes three arguments:
a [readable stream][readable]
from which the JSON will be parsed;
a selector argument for determining matches,
which may be a string, a regular expression or a predicate function;
and an [options](#options-for-parsing-functions) object.

If the selector is a string,
it will be compared to property keys
to determine whether
each item in the data is a match.
If it is a regular expression,
the comparison will be made
by calling the [RegExp `test` method][regexp-test]
with the property key.
Predicate functions will be called with three arguments:
`key`, `value` and `depth`.
If the result of the predicate is a truthy value
then the item will be deemed a match.

If there are any syntax errors in the JSON,
a `dataError` event will be emitted.
If any other errors occur,
an `error` event will be emitted.

## How do I write a JSON file?

```js
const bfj = require('bfj');

bfj.write(path, data, options)
  .then(() => {
    // :)
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // :(
  });
```

`write` returns a [bluebird promise][promise]
and asynchronously serialises a data structure
to a JSON file on disk.
The promise is resolved
when the file has been written,
or rejected with the error
if writing failed.

It takes three arguments;
the path to the JSON file,
the data structure to serialise
and an [options](#options-for-serialisation-functions) object.

## How do I create a stream of JSON?

```js
const bfj = require('bfj');

const stream = bfj.streamify(data, options);

// Get data out of the stream with event handlers
stream.on('data', chunk => { /* ... */ });
stream.on('end', () => { /* ... */);
stream.on('error', () => { /* ... */);
stream.on('dataError', () => { /* ... */);

// ...or you can pipe it to another stream
stream.pipe(someOtherStream);
```

`streamify` returns a [readable stream][readable]
and asynchronously serialises
a data structure to JSON,
pushing the result
to the returned stream.

It takes two arguments;
the data structure to serialise
and an [options](#options-for-serialisation-functions) object.

If there a circular reference is encountered in the data
and `options.circular` is not set to `'ignore'`,
a `dataError` event will be emitted.
If any other errors occur,
an `error` event will be emitted.

## How do I create a JSON string?

```js
const bfj = require('bfj');

bfj.stringify(data, options)
  .then(json => {
    // :)
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // :(
  });
```

`stringify` returns a [bluebird promise][promise] and
asynchronously serialises a data structure
to a JSON string.
The promise is resolved
to the JSON string
when serialisation is complete.

It takes two arguments;
the data structure to serialise
and an [options](#options-for-serialisation-functions) object.

## What other methods are there?

### bfj.walk (stream, options)

```js
const bfj = require('bfj');

const emitter = bfj.walk(fs.createReadStream(path), options);

emitter.on(bfj.events.array, () => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.object, () => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.property, name => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.string, value => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.number, value => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.literal, value => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.endArray, () => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.endObject, () => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.error, error => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.dataError, error => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.end, () => { /* ... */ });
```

`walk` returns an [event emitter][eventemitter]
and asynchronously walks
a stream of JSON data,
emitting events
as it encounters
tokens.

It takes two arguments;
a [readable stream][readable]
from which
the JSON
will be read
and an [options](#options-for-parsing-functions) object.

The emitted events
are defined
as public properties
of an object,
`bfj.events`:

* `bfj.events.array`
  indicates that
  an array context
  has been entered
  by encountering
  the `[` character.

* `bfj.events.endArray`
  indicates that
  an array context
  has been left
  by encountering
  the `]` character.

* `bfj.events.object`
  indicates that
  an object context
  has been entered
  by encountering
  the `{` character.

* `bfj.events.endObject`
  indicates that
  an object context
  has been left
  by encountering
  the `}` character.

* `bfj.events.property`
  indicates that
  a property
  has been encountered
  in an object.
  The listener
  will be passed
  the name of the property
  as its argument
  and the next event
  to be emitted
  will represent
  the property's value.

* `bfj.events.string`
  indicates that
  a string
  has been encountered.
  The listener
  will be passed
  the value
  as its argument.

* `bfj.events.number`
  indicates that
  a number
  has been encountered.
  The listener
  will be passed
  the value
  as its argument.

* `bfj.events.literal`
  indicates that
  a JSON literal
  (either `true`, `false` or `null`)
  has been encountered.
  The listener
  will be passed
  the value
  as its argument.

* `bfj.events.error`
  indicates that
  an error was caught
  from one of the event handlers
  in user code.
  The listener
  will be passed
  the `Error` instance
  as its argument.

* `bfj.events.dataError`
  indicates that
  a syntax error was encountered
  in the incoming JSON stream.
  The listener
  will be passed
  an `Error` instance
  decorated with `actual`, `expected`, `lineNumber` and `columnNumber` properties
  as its argument.

* `bfj.events.end`
  indicates that
  the end of the input
  has been reached
  and the stream is closed.

* `bfj.events.endLine`
  indicates that a root-level newline character
  has been encountered in an [NDJSON](#can-it-handle-newline-delimited-json-ndjson) stream.
  Only emitted if the `ndjson` [option](#options-for-parsing-functions) is set.

If you are using `bfj.walk`
to sequentially parse items in an array,
you might also be interested in
the [bfj-collections] module.

### bfj.eventify (data, options)

```js
const bfj = require('bfj');

const emitter = bfj.eventify(data, options);

emitter.on(bfj.events.array, () => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.object, () => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.property, name => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.string, value => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.number, value => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.literal, value => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.endArray, () => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.endObject, () => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.error, error => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.dataError, error => { /* ... */ });
emitter.on(bfj.events.end, () => { /* ... */ });
```

`eventify` returns an [event emitter][eventemitter]
and asynchronously traverses
a data structure depth-first,
emitting events as it
encounters items.
By default it coerces
promises, buffers and iterables
to JSON-friendly values.

It takes two arguments;
the data structure to traverse
and an [options](#options-for-serialisation-functions) object.

The emitted events
are defined
as public properties
of an object,
`bfj.events`:

* `bfj.events.array`
  indicates that
  an array
  has been encountered.

* `bfj.events.endArray`
  indicates that
  the end of an array
  has been encountered.

* `bfj.events.object`
  indicates that
  an object
  has been encountered.

* `bfj.events.endObject`
  indicates that
  the end of an object
  has been encountered.

* `bfj.events.property`
  indicates that
  a property
  has been encountered
  in an object.
  The listener
  will be passed
  the name of the property
  as its argument
  and the next event
  to be emitted
  will represent
  the property's value.

* `bfj.events.string`
  indicates that
  a string
  has been encountered.
  The listener
  will be passed
  the value
  as its argument.

* `bfj.events.number`
  indicates that
  a number
  has been encountered.
  The listener
  will be passed
  the value
  as its argument.

* `bfj.events.literal`
  indicates that
  a JSON literal
  (either `true`, `false` or `null`)
  has been encountered.
  The listener
  will be passed
  the value
  as its argument.

* `bfj.events.error`
  indicates that
  an error was caught
  from one of the event handlers
  in user code.
  The listener
  will be passed
  the `Error` instance
  as its argument.

* `bfj.events.dataError`
  indicates that
  a circular reference was encountered in the data
  and the `circular` option was not set to `'ignore'`.
  The listener
  will be passed
  an `Error` instance
  as its argument.

* `bfj.events.end`
  indicates that
  the end of the data
  has been reached and
  no further events
  will be emitted.

## What options can I specify?

### Options for parsing functions

* `options.reviver`:
  Transformation function,
  invoked depth-first
  against the parsed
  data structure.
  This option
  is analagous to the
  [reviver parameter for JSON.parse][reviver].

* `options.yieldRate`:
  The number of data items to process
  before yielding to the event loop.
  Smaller values yield to the event loop more frequently,
  meaning less time will be consumed by bfj per tick
  but the overall parsing time will be slower.
  Larger values yield to the event loop less often,
  meaning slower tick times but faster overall parsing time.
  The default value is `16384`.

* `options.Promise`:
  Promise constructor that will be used
  for promises returned by all methods.
  If you set this option,
  please be aware that some promise implementations
  (including native promises)
  may cause your process to die
  with out-of-memory exceptions.
  Defaults to [bluebird's implementation][promise],
  which does not have that problem.

* `options.ndjson`:
  If set to `true`,
  newline characters at the root level
  will be treated as delimiters between
  discrete chunks of JSON.
  See [NDJSON](#can-it-handle-newline-delimited-json-ndjson) for more information.

* `options.numbers`:
  F
