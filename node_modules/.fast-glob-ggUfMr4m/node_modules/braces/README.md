> Bash-like brace expansion, implemented in JavaScript. Safer than other brace expansion libs, with complete support for the Bash 4.3 braces specification, without sacrificing speed.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save braces
```

## Why use braces?

Brace patterns are great for matching ranges. Users (and implementors) shouldn't have to think about whether or not they will break their application (or yours) from accidentally defining an aggressive brace pattern. _Braces is the only library that offers a [solution to this problem](#performance)_.

* **Safe(r)**: Braces isn't vulnerable to DoS attacks like [brace-expansion](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion), [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) and [multimatch](https://github.com/sindresorhus/multimatch) (a different bug than the [other regex DoS bug](https://medium.com/node-security/minimatch-redos-vulnerability-590da24e6d3c#.jew0b6mpc)).
* **Accurate**: complete support for the [Bash 4.3 Brace Expansion](www.gnu.org/software/bash/) specification (passes all of the Bash braces tests)
* **[fast and performant](#benchmarks)**: Starts fast, runs fast and [scales well](#performance) as patterns increase in complexity.
* **Organized code base**: with parser and compiler that are eas(y|ier) to maintain and update when edge cases crop up.
* **Well-tested**: thousands of test assertions. Passes 100% of the [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) and [brace-expansion](https://github.com/juliangruber/brace-expansion) unit tests as well (as of the writing of this).

## Usage

The main export is a function that takes one or more brace `patterns`
