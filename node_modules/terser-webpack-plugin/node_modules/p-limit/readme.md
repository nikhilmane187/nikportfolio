# p-limit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/p-limit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/p-limit)

> Run multiple promise-returning & async functions with limited concurrency

## Install

```
$ npm install p-limit
```

## Usage

```js
const pLimit = require('p-limit');

const limit = pLimit(1);

const input = [
	limit(() => fetchSomething('foo')),
	limit(() => fetchSomething('bar')),
	limit(() => doSomething())
];

(async () => {
	// Only one promise is run at once
	const result = await Promise.all(input);
	console.log(result);
})();
```

## API

### pLimit(concurrency)

Returns a `limit` function.

#### concurrency

Type: `number`\
Minimum: `1`\
Default: `Infinity`

Concurrency limit.

### limit(fn, ...args)

Returns the promise returned by calling `fn(...args)`.

#### fn

Type: `Function`

Promise-returning/async function.

#### args

Any arguments to pass through to `fn`.

Support for passing arguments on to the `fn` is provided in order to be able to avoid creating unnecessary closures. You probably don't need this optimization unless you're pushing a *lot* of functions.

### limit.activeCount

The number of promises that are currently running.

### limit.pendingCount

The number of promises that are waiting to run (i.e. their internal `fn` was not called yet).

### limit.clearQueue()

Discard
